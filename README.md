# MongoToDoList

This is a full stack list manager using the MEAN Stack.  It maintains three lists, labeled as Hi, Medium, and Low Priority tasks.  All task items are stored in the Mongo database, and can be deleted or edited.  Angular is used for connecting the UI and JavaScript application.

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AngularJS, Node.js, and MongoDB were used.
